Arduino based BBQ smoker temperature controller with cloud analitics and notifications("add charcoal", "add wood", etc)

Hello, my name is Alex, I'm from Russia and I love BBQ!
So, BBQ Smokers are not so popular in Russia, thats why I'am the best in my small city ( not serious :) )!

There are a lot of different handmade of factorymade BBQ Smoker temperature controllers, but for me all of them have too many limitations.
For example, for assembling very popular "HeaterMeter" you need to be an good engineer with soldering skills.
Or, you need to spent a lot of time to assemble, debug and configure some other DIY projects.
Or it cost too much!

As for me, this is not an easy way.

I hope, that I can explain to you, how to get very easy, cheap, really, extra-cheap controller with an optional cloud monitoring!

Let's begin!


What's is the main problem for Low&Slow smoking?! Right, it is take too many hours! You need to constantly maintain temperature level and smoke density.
